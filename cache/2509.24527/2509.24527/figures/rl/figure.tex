Agent performance in Minecraft without environment interaction.
All methods have access to the same contractor dataset\citep{vpt} with image inputs and low-level mouse and keyboard actions.
We report the success rates of important items obtained during 60-minute episodes that start in random worlds and from empty inventory, computed over 1000 episodes.
Leveraging imagination training, \method is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft purely from offline experience.
\method substantially outperforms OpenAI's VPT offline agent\citep{vpt} while using 100$\times$ less data.
It also outperforms our VLA agent \citep{kim2024openvla,intelligence2025pi05}, which leverages the general knowledge of the Gemma 3 vision-language model\citep{team2025gemma3}, nearly tripling its success rate for crafting iron pickaxes.
