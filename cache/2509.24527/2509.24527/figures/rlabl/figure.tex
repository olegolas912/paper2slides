Agent ablations on the offline diamond challenge.
We report success rates and time needed to reach an item for four milestone items.
\method outperforms methods based on behavioral cloning in both metrics, demonstrating that imagination training improves both the robustness and efficiency of the policy.
Moreover, using the world model representations for behavioral cloning outperforms using Gemma 3 or training from scratch.
